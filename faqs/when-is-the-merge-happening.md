**Short Answer:**<br>
The best current (non-official) estimate is sometime in Q1 2022.

**Long Answer:**<br>
At the time of writing there is no definitive date for "The Merge".

Now that the Ethereum community has successfully implemented the London hard fork, the Ethereum core dev community is focusing the bulk of its effort on the switch to proof-of-stake (PoS). The Ethereum PoS chain is currently running and will undergo its first hard fork (Codenamed Altair) in late October 2021 - before "The Merge".

In early October, core Ethereum developers gathered for an in-person workshop to create a multi-client testnet of the entire merge process; the effort [was successful](https://twitter.com/parithosh_j/status/1446598943912177664), with all combinations of 3 execution clients and 4 consensus clients included. The next step is to make a more professional public testnet (similar to Ropsten and Goerli). Once the merge transition and post-merge steady state have been verified to be safe, the immediate next step will be to schedule the time and release the mainnet clients for the merge.
